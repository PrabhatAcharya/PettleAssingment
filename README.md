## Introduction
 This task involves reviewing a wireframe and mobile app screens for a booking management system, creating an HTML and CSS layout based on the design, making the webpage responsive using media queries, fetching data from a fakestore API, and testing the responsiveness on various devices.

## Features
The webpage showcases a booking management system with a responsive design that adapts to large and medium screens. It includes a filter function for sorting bookings as "All Bookings," "Upcoming Bookings," and "Checked-In." Additionally, pagination is implemented to efficiently display a large number of bookings.
and the project is deployed at https://www.netlify.com/
## design decisions or assumptions
To align with the requirements of the assignment and work with the data from the fakestore API, some design decisions and assumptions were made. Instead of displaying booking-related data, the decision was made to showcase products. For the "Upcoming Bookings" section, a display of electronics products was chosen, while for the "Checked-In" section, women's clothing products were selected. These design decisions were made to demonstrate the functionality of the filter and pagination features effectively.
## Installation

Files Created for Booking Management System:

index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the webpage. It includes the structure of the webpage, such as the header, navigation, and content sections. The necessary CSS and JavaScript files are linked within this file.

index.js: The JavaScript file responsible for handling the logic and functionality of the booking management system. It retrieves data from the fakestore API, filters the bookings, implements pagination, and dynamically updates the webpage with the relevant information.

index.css: The CSS file that styles the elements and layout of the webpage. It defines the colors, typography, spacing, and overall visual appearance of the booking management system.

calendar.js: A separate JavaScript file specifically for handling the calendar functionality. It manages date selection, date formatting, and related interactions within the booking management system.

calendar.css: The CSS file that contains styles specific to the calendar component. It defines the appearance of the calendar, including the styling of days, months, navigation buttons, and other relevant elements.

By separating the code into different files, it promotes modularity and maintainability, making it easier to manage and update specific functionalities of the booking management system.
